# Grub-Dash

Project is still under progress, the aim of this project is to create a triangular connection of small restaurants and catering services to private delivery services and consumers.
Currently, the the Gateway to the Back-End API is under alpha-testing, I have used Node.js and Express.js to build it. The Database Schema has been designed and I will be using Relational Databse Technology POstgresSQL.

After the Back-End is completed, I have fantastic UI designs ready to be built using HTML, CSS and CSS Framework Bootstrap 5 with React.js, React-Native and its Redux library. Tentative schedule for full scale deployment is May 25th. The link will be provided here. Thank You for your Patience.
